  cardDescription: 'This is the description of the test enemy card. This is a placeholder
    description and serves no material purpose. The information contained within
    this description is completely worthless and of no value to anyone. By continuing
    to read you are not only wasting your own time but also my time in having to
    write more description to satisfy your desire to keep reading. For those of you
    still around I hope it was worth it. BEANS!
